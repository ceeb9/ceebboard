maimai leaderboard bot - scrapes data from dxnet via searching friend codes.

install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

the file needed for authentication is `auth.txt`. it looks like the following:
```
prod_bot_token::::<prod bot token>
dev_bot_token::::<dev bot token>
sega_username::::<sega username>
sega_password::::<sega password>
```
fill in those details and save it in `auth.txt` in the root directory and you should be good to go. 
you don't need two tokens if you're only running a dev bot, of course. just change the commented line at the bottom of `startup.py` to choose which token to login with.
